## Project Overview
I am doing this Project individually.
- **Dataset(s):** E.g., Fluo-N2DH-GOWT1 (tracks 01 & 02)
- **Team roles:** segmentation lead, tracking lead, evaluation lead
- **Summary:** Briefly explain your approach and what makes it unique.

## Segmentation Results

| Method | Dataset | Track | Mean IoU | Notes |
| ------ | ------- | ----- | -------- | ----- |
| Classical SVM | Fluo-N2DH-GOWT1 | 01 | 0.73 | RBF kernel, window=5 |
| CNN Baseline | Fluo-N2DH-GOWT1 | 02 | 0.81 | Lightweight U-Net |

- Describe preprocessing, feature engineering, and model choices.
- Link to notebooks or scripts that reproduce each row.

## Tracking Results (Grad/Honors)

| Tracker | Metric | Score | Notes |
| ------- | ------ | ----- | ----- |
| ASM + IoU linking | ID switches | 4 | Initialized from previous frame |

Explain how you propagate identities across frames and highlight failure cases.

## Reproduction Checklist

1. `conda env create -f environment.yml`
2. `python scripts/setup_data.py --dataset Fluo-N2DH-GOWT1 --splits training test`
3. `python scripts/train_svm.py ...`
4. `python scripts/eval_seg.py ...`
5. Additional steps for custom models.
